> What does a provenance record establish, and what can it omit?

**Learning target.** Distinguish recorded history, missing history and the truth of a claim.

## Before the workshop

Download the [week 11 pack](/packs/week-11/): `manifest-before.json` (metadata
recorded when `image/output-7`, from week 4, was deposited into the archive),
`manifest-after.json` (metadata on the public archive copy), and
`stripping-log.txt` (the publishing pipeline's own account of what it changed
between the two). Do not open `reveal/` yet.

**Reading.** C2PA Technical Specification v2.1, §1.2 Scope and §2.3.10
Authenticity, freely available at
[spec.c2pa.org](https://spec.c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html).
Read for what "authenticity" means in this specification: a set of assertions
that can be cryptographically verified as *tied to a signer's key and free of
tampering since signing* — not a judgement that the assertions themselves are
true. This week's manifests are plain, unsigned JSON, not C2PA credentials,
and the difference is the point.

## Check — 5 minutes

The stripping log names two operations: removing `contributorId` and removing
`depositTimestamp`. Comparing the two manifests directly, name one field that
changed between them that the log does not mention.

*Indicative answer.* Either is acceptable: the `software` field was renamed to
`creationTool` (its value survived, only the key changed), or the metadata
checksum differs (because it is computed over the whole field set, and that
set changed). The log's two listed operations do not account for either.

## Receive — 15 minutes

Confirm you can state, in your own words, the difference between a field that
is **retained** (present and unchanged), a field that underwent a
**documented removal** (absent, and the log says why), a field with an
**undocumented change** (different between the manifests, but the log is
silent about it), and a field that was **never captured** (absent in both
manifests, at every stage — its absence is not this operation's doing).

## Investigate — 40 minutes

**Compare the two manifests against the log (15 minutes).** For each field
present in either manifest, record whether it appears in `manifest-before.json`,
whether it appears in `manifest-after.json`, and whether the stripping log
mentions it changing.

**Classify every field (15 minutes).** Using the four categories from Receive,
classify every field into your own copy of the worksheet. Pay particular
attention to `gpsCoordinates` and `cameraModel`: both are absent from *both*
manifests. Before concluding the stripping operation removed them, check
whether they were ever present to remove — per week 4, Output 7 never
retained EXIF at any stage.

**Propose one proportionate archive-policy improvement (10 minutes).** Given
what the log did and did not capture, propose one specific, bounded change to
what the publishing pipeline logs — not a demand for full cryptographic
signing, which is a different and much larger commitment (see this week's
reading). State what your proposed change would have caught here, and what it
still would not catch.

## Evaluate — 30 minutes

Write your completed audit worksheet before opening `reveal/`. Then answer:
if you had trusted the stripping log alone, without comparing the manifests
field by field, which of your findings would you have missed? Name one way a
provenance record that cites another provenance record — rather than an
independent, retained measurement — can loop back on itself without ever
being checked against anything outside the loop, and say why that is not the
same failure as this week's undocumented rename.

## Deposit — 30 minutes

Open `reveal/analysis.md` (ask your tutor for the link once your worksheet is done) and compare it
against your own worksheet. Deposit your completed audit worksheet, labelled
by field, into the [Image collection](/archive/#image). Week 12 reuses this
audit; do not attempt to re-verify every earlier week's evidence from scratch.

## Accessible route

`manifest-before.json`, `manifest-after.json` and `stripping-log.txt` are all
plain text; no image needs to be looked at.

## Assessment

Peer review the scope, assumptions and costing in another student's draft for
[The Lossless Argument](/assessments/the-lossless-argument/) using a short
checklist: does their preservation proposal name what a provenance record in
their scenario would and would not establish, the way this week's audit does?
