> Can different histories fit the same available image evidence?

**Learning target.** Show that a defined evidence set cannot separate two
histories, then specify evidence that could — and accept when the answer stays
open.

## Before the workshop

Open the [week 4 pack](/packs/week-04/) and read `observations.csv` and
`tolerance.txt`. Ten minutes. Do not open the reveal.

**Reading.** Hito Steyerl, "In Defense of the Poor Image", *e-flux journal* #10
(2009), available free at e-flux.com. Read it for the argument about what
circulation does to images. The lecture is explicit about which of its claims
are cultural and which would need separate technical evidence.

## Last week, and this week

Week 3 started from a known process and asked how to test its effect. You
controlled what you changed.

This week runs the other way. You start from **one output and no history**, and
ask whether the evidence you have can tell you where it came from. It cannot
always, and the skill is saying so precisely rather than guessing.

## The specimen

**Output 7.** Provenance unknown — that is the question. Everything currently
known about it is five lines in `observations.csv`: dimensions, file size,
chroma subsampling, and the absence of EXIF.

Two processing histories have been proposed. Route A resizes once and saves
once. Route B saves, resizes, then saves again. **Both end with the same save**,
at the same quality, so nothing about the final encode can tell them apart —
the only thing they disagree about is whether a full-size JPEG was written
before the resize. **What each one predicts is supplied**, beside what was
observed — nothing in this pack would let you derive
a file size from a set of steps, and pretending otherwise would make the exercise
impossible rather than demanding. Your work is applying the tolerance.

`tolerance.txt` is the part to read carefully. A route is compatible on file
size when **its prediction is within 15 KB of the observed size**; dimensions,
subsampling and EXIF presence must match exactly. If more than one route
satisfies that, file size does not distinguish them.

The 15 KB figure is a **scenario rule**. It is set for this exercise so you can
apply a stated threshold consistently. It is not an empirically validated
forensic tolerance, and you should not carry it anywhere else.

**Indistinguishable is a claim about the evidence, not about the files.** Two
images that this evidence cannot separate may differ in every byte. Saying
"indistinguishable" without saying *under what* is the error this week exists
to prevent.

The scenario is authored throughout. The observations, the predictions and the
evidence records were written for this exercise; none of them was produced by
running image software, and nothing here supports a claim about how any real
tool behaves.

## Investigate — 40 minutes

**Test both histories against the observations (15 minutes).** For each route,
take its predicted values from `observations.csv` and compare them with the
observed values, applying the tolerance. Record the difference per measurement,
not just a verdict — "compatible" is a conclusion you show your working for.

Then do the part the pack cannot do for you: sketch a **third** history that
would also fit. Only two were written on cards, and that is a fact about who was
asked, not about what is possible.

**Choose one further evidence item, and commit first (10 minutes).**
`evidence-menu.csv` lists five things you could ask for. Two do not exist, and
their absence is marked with a reason. The three that do exist each have a file
in `evidence/`.

Pick one. Then, **before you open its file**, write down what result would
favour route A and what result would favour route B. If you cannot say that in
advance, the item cannot discriminate for you — pick another, or record that you
could not.

**Open only that file, then revise (15 minutes).** Each file holds the result of
one request and nothing else. Update your conclusion and record what is still
unresolved.

Not every available item separates the routes. If yours does not, you have not
failed the exercise — say what you asked for, why it was a reasonable request,
and what it turned out to be silent about.

## Evaluate — 30 minutes

Write the ambiguity report you are depositing: two route diagrams, your
observation table, the scope of indistinguishability, and your evidence request
with its justification. Then three paragraphs.

1. **State the scope.** "These routes are indistinguishable" is incomplete.
   Finish the sentence: indistinguishable *on which measurements, at what
   tolerance*.
2. **What does your third route do to your conclusion?** You sketched one in the
   investigation. Say what its existence costs any claim you reached, and whether
   your chosen evidence would have excluded it too.
3. **What is the weakest claim you can defend?** If your evidence rules out one
   route, you have not established another. Write the claim your evidence
   actually supports, and notice that it is smaller than the one you wanted.

## What you should find

Both routes fit. Dimensions, subsampling and the missing EXIF are identical
either way, and the predicted file sizes are 6 KB and 7 KB from the observation,
both inside the 15 KB rule.

So the initial evidence does not determine the process, and no amount of
staring at it will change that. The question is which further observation would.

One item separates them, and it is worth being precise about why. The retained
transformation record **names** a full-size JPEG as the input to the resize, and
the input hash matches a file that was present. Route A resizes the source
directly and never has a full-size JPEG to read, so route A is excluded.

Two available items do not separate them, and they fail the same way. The
working-directory listing shows a full-size JPEG existed before the output —
which looks decisive and is not, because **co-existence is not descent**. That
interim file could be an unrelated export, with the output made straight from
the source. The handover note arrives at the same gap from a different
direction: it confirms a big version exists somewhere and says nothing about
whether it was read.

That distinction — between a record that lists what existed and a record that
names what read what — is the whole week in one sentence. Both requests are
reasonable, and a report that asks for one, notices the gap and leaves the
question open is a correct answer here.

And even having excluded route A, notice what you are left with. Any history
that saved at full size before resizing would produce a record of that shape — a
save at a different quality, or a route through a third size. **Ruling out one
route is not establishing another**, and the claim you can defend is "not route
A, and consistent with route B".

## Deposit

Both documented branches go into the [image collection](/archive/#image), with
the source and the logs retained. Weeks 10 and 11 come back to this collection:
week 10 asks whether a restoration of this output matches the original, and
week 11 asks what a provenance record for it would and would not establish.

## The five-minute check

Two route cards fit a supplied thumbnail. Propose one available evidence item
that could distinguish them, and explain how.

*Indicative answer.* Any item is acceptable if you say in advance what result
would favour which route. An answer that proposes an item, explains what it
would show, and then notes that the item may turn out to be non-discriminating
scores the limitation point. "The evidence remains insufficient" is a correct
answer here when it is argued.

## Assessment

For [The Stemma](/assessments/the-stemma/), this is the reasoning behind its
20% criterion: reconstruct the supported portions and **mark the unknown
portions as unknown**. "Cannot resolve this edge" earns full credit where the
evidence does not resolve it, and this week is where you practise writing that
sentence so it reads as a finding rather than as a shrug.

For [The Chain](/assessments/the-chain/), bound your conclusion. State the
source, the settings and the measure it holds for.
