> How can we measure a copy becoming harder to read?

**Learning target.** Define a repeatable measurement, and explain why two
readers of the same copy disagree without concluding that legibility is merely
a matter of opinion.

## Before the workshop

Download the [week 1 pack](/packs/week-01/) and read `card.txt` and
`counting-rule.txt`. Ten minutes.

**Reading.** David Owen, *Copies in Seconds* (Simon & Schuster, 2004), chapter 1,
on Chester Carlson and the years xerography spent being refused. No online copy
is linkable, so the lecture supplies a summary of the specific claim used: that
the technology was repeatedly judged to solve a problem nobody had.

## The specimen

**Copy room test card 0S1I-B85l.** Four lines, built from characters that look
like one another — `0` and `O`, `1` and `l` and `I`, `5` and `S`, `8` and `B`,
`2` and `Z`, `6` and `G`, `9` and `g`. That is what a legibility card is for:
it concentrates the failure so it can be counted.

You are given four copies of it:

| Copy | Channel | Operations | What was done to it |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Digital control | digital | 8 | Copied byte for byte eight times, checksummed at each step |
| Photocopy | photocopy | 1 | One pass, at settings held fixed for every generation |
| Photocopy | photocopy | 4 | A copy of the third copy, same machine and settings |
| Photocopy | photocopy | 8 | A copy of the seventh copy, same machine and settings |

The control runs **the same eight operations** as the longest photocopy chain.
That is the whole point of it: a control copied once would tell you nothing
about a chain of eight, and the comparison this week rests on would not hold.

Each copy comes as **two transcriptions**, made by two different readers. Every
transcription is exactly as long as the card, so you can compare position by
position and never have to decide what lines up with what.

Everything in the pack is an authored teaching scenario. These are constructed
transcriptions, not recordings of what a real photocopier and two real readers
did, and every file says so.

## Investigate — 40 minutes

**Read the transcriptions (10 minutes).** Take one copy and both its readers.
Mark every position where a transcription differs from the card. A position
transcribed as `·` is an *illegible*: the reader could not resolve the character
and declined to guess. That is not the same as getting it wrong, and your table
keeps the two apart.

**Count all four copies (15 minutes).** Apply the rule in `counting-rule.txt`
without modifying it. `worksheet.csv` arrives blank; fill in misreadings,
illegibles and total for each copy and each reader.

Then count one transcription a second time. You should get the same number. This
is a check on **your** repeatability, not on the rule's: the algorithm is
deterministic by construction, and what you are testing is whether you applied
it the same way twice.

**Compare readers, and check the control (15 minutes).** Record the **positions**
where the readers differ, not only their totals. Two readers can reach the same
total by disagreeing in different places, and the totals alone would hide that.

Then look at the control. It ran eight operations. What did it come back as?

## Evaluate — 30 minutes

Write the table up with a method note. Then answer four questions in a paragraph
each — these are what the week is actually assessed on, not the counting.

1. **Why not average the two readers?** An average would give you one number per
   copy, which is tidier. Say what it would destroy.
2. **What does the control support?** State the claim it licenses, precisely, and
   say what makes the comparison fair.
3. **What can your evidence not establish?** One card, one machine, two readers,
   one authored scenario. Name a conclusion someone might draw from your table
   that the table does not carry.
4. **What would you change?** One concrete improvement to this experiment, and
   what it would buy you.

A worked answer is in the pack. Open it after you have your own table and your
own four paragraphs.

## What you should find

Inside the photocopy channel the totals rise with the number of operations. The
control ran the same eight operations and came back with none.

That pair of facts is the course's opening claim and its first qualification.
This copying process damages what it copies. Copying as such does not.

The second finding is smaller and more awkward. After a single photocopy
operation the two readers already disagree: one found an error, the other found
none, in the same copy. Both followed the same transcription procedure; the
scenario records them interpreting one damaged mark differently. There is still
a fact of the matter — the card says what it says — but a reader facing an
ambiguous mark has to decide, and two people decide differently.

This is where the week could go badly. It is tempting to conclude that the
measurement is therefore worthless. Keep three things apart:

- the **counting algorithm is deterministic** — the same transcription against
  the same card gives the same number every time;
- **your own repeatability** is something you check, by counting twice;
- **readers still differ**, because resolving a damaged mark is an
  interpretation.

Legibility is a relation between a copy and a reader. Note too that reader R1
scores below R2 after four operations and above R2 after eight, so you cannot
even rank the readers consistently — which is why an average would have been
worse than useless here, not merely less informative.

## Deposit

Your character-error table, with the control recorded beside the photocopy
generations, goes into the [print collection](/archive/#print). Week 2 reuses
the discipline — a stated rule, applied the same way to every copy, with
disagreement reported rather than smoothed — on a recording rather than a page.

## The five-minute check

Two copies of the same card. Cite one observed difference between them, and name
one thing that difference cannot establish.

*Indicative answer.* A higher error count can support an ordering under
controlled conditions — same card, same rule, same reader. It is not an
independent timestamp: a first-generation copy from a failing machine can be
worse than an eighth-generation copy from a good one, and nothing in the count
itself tells you which you are holding.

## Assessment

This week introduces [The Chain](/assessments/the-chain/), where you will run
your own artefact through ten copying steps. Two things to note now.

**Record your prediction before you start.** Ten percent of that assessment is
comparing what you expected to lose with what you actually lost. A prediction
revised after the fact scores nothing.

**Include a control.** The one in this pack is the whole reason week 1 can make
a claim rather than a gesture. No mark is given for dramatic degradation.

The first [Generation Check](/assessments/generation-checks/) is the one above.
Best ten of twelve count, so a missed week costs nothing.
